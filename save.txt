My name is Rony Das, and I’m 26 years old.
I began my programming journey in 2019, driven by curiosity about how real-time applications — especially those used in stock markets and trading — work. This interest led me to explore how such systems are built.

I started learning C and C++, which were my first programming languages. To build a strong foundation, I joined the CSE Fundamentals with Phitron, where I focused on problem-solving, logic building, and data structures and algorithms (DSA). I dedicated significant time to solving problems on various online judges. Additionally, I joined numerous online courses and bootcamps.

After strengthening my core skills, I transitioned into development and built several real-world and practice projects. Currently, I’m focusing on system design and deepening my understanding of scalable architectures.

I'm always eager for opportunities to work on challenging projects. I am confident in my ability to quickly adapt to any technology stack and make effective contributions to a team.
